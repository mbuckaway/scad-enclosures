# SCAD Enclosures

This repo is a set of enclosures downloaded from Thingaverse and elsewhere and modified for my own use. The models can be used with SCAD to generate STL files for 3D printing.

## Best Models

The best models to use are the enclosure_snap and project_box_screws_r3. enclosure_snap has a snap on lid and is useful for small projects used indoors. project_box_screws_r3 is simular to enclosure snap, but has a screw on lid for a bit more secure project box.
